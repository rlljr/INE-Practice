# Create ASCII Box
# Write a function create_box that takes three inputs: height (rows), width (columns), and a character char and creates a height Ã— width box using the character char.
#
# For this exercise, it's recommended to use a nested for-loop. There are other ways of solving it (which might be a good starting point), but try reaching the nested for-loop solution.
#
# >>> create_box(3, 4, '*')
# '****
#  ****
#  ****'
# >>> create_box(2, 2, '@')
# '@@
#  @@'
# IMPORTANT: You need to return your box, not just print it.

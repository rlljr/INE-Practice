# Get Positions of Char
# Use a for loop with enumerate to complete the function get_positions_of_char so that it looks at another_string and searches for characters that match char_being_searched_for. If it's a match, add the position to a result string followed by a comma. Example:
#
# get_positions_of_char("aabcda", "a") # Returns "0,1,5,"
# Hint: You might have to put str() around to position to change it from an integer into a string so you can add it to your result string.

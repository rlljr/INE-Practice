# Get Third Element
# Complete the get_third_elem function so it always returns the third element in the list. Because the first two elements looked at us funny.


my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
def get_third_elem(list_of_stuff):
    third_elem = list_of_stuff[2]
    return third_elem
    pass

print(get_third_elem(my_list))

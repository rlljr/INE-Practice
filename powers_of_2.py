# Powers of 2
# You've done something similar to this with a while loop, now do it with a for loop! You'll have to use the range() function.
#
# Complete powers_of_2 using a for loop so that receives the power and returns 2 to that power.
#
# Examples:
#
# >>> powers_of_2(0)
# 1
#
# >>> powers_of_2(1)
# 2
#
# >>> powers_of_2(2)
# 4
#
# >>> powers_of_2(3)
# 8

def powers_of_2(power):
    return 2**power
    pass
